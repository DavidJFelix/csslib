#csslib

csslib is a library of "Wikipedia official" hex keys by their color names.
This library came about as a convienence for when people would ask me to
change the color of a web page to some esoteric color name. I got tired of
looking them up and picking between shades.

Here are some default colors for backgrounds and text. Apply the class to
use them. I'm working on converting this current list into something more
modern like SCSS/SASS or LESS.
